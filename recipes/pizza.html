    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make pizza dough with rapid-rise yeast instead of buying pre-made dough at the grocery store. It's quick and easy to make from scratch, and it tastes better too.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 envelope Fleischmann's® RapidRise Yeast*</li>
        <li>1 cup very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 2 cups flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl</li>
        <li>Stir in very warm water and oil until combined, then stir in just enough of remaining 1/2 cup flour to make a soft dough</li>
        <li>Knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>shape dough into six to eight 7-inch-diameter rounds.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly oil your selected pan(s) and sprinkle with cornmeal.</li>
        <li>Top pizza as desired. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and cheese is melted, 20 to 30 minutes</li>
    </ol>
